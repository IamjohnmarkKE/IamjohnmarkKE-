| The Untamed Myth | The Dowry Blame |

| True story behind the cattle raiding issue in infamous pastoralism involved activities Counties, is due to the one major unspoken cultural related deal that emerges as ' Dowry ' |
| Though creating awareness on peace at boarders via Peace initiative/ Chief Barazas/ Both national and inter-counties Peace meetings , it's still a major issue | For just one reason!? | 
| Let's update our people that for one to be acknowledged as a man in a community or a clan doesn't require dowry payment with Herds of Cattle/Goats/Sheep's/Donkey/Camels coz that's tha key to all tha raiding related undisputed issue in our counties boarders | 
| Tell them we have other better and sustainable modes of dowry payment that acts decent and of the 21st century Men who we term as ' Big Boyz ' |
